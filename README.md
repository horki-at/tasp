# How to compile
To compile just run:
$ make

To run the program (also specify arguments if you need):
$ ./main ...args...

When you change a file, just run make and it will be VERY fast
$ make

If you want to get rid of generated files (which should we rare):
$ make clean

# TODO
1) make multiple actions possible
